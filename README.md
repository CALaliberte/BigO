# BigO Notation in Code Optimization

## Optimizing Code

1. **Eliminate unnecessary operations:** Remove any unnecessary computations or loops that do not contribute to the algorithm's functionality.

2. **Use efficient data structures:** Choose the appropriate data structures for your algorithm based on their time complexity. For example, use a hash table (O(1) lookup) instead of a list (O(n) lookup) when searching for elements.

3. **Reduce the number of iterations:** Minimize the number of iterations in loops by using techniques like binary search or dynamic programming.

4. **Avoid unnecessary sorting:** If your algorithm requires sorted input, consider using a sorting algorithm with a lower time complexity (e.g., O(n log n) instead of O(n^2)).
